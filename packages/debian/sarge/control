Description: UPnP MediaServer
 MediaTomb is an open source (GPL) UPnP MediaServer with a nice web user
 interface, it allows you to stream your digital media through your home network
 and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP compatible devices.
 .
 MediaTomb implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that can be found
 on http://www.upnp.org/. The current implementation focuses on parts that are
 required by the specification, however we look into extending the functionality
 to cover the optional parts of the spec as well.
