Q:  I am trying to run mediatomb in deamon mode (-d) but get upnp error -205 

A:  In the terminal where you are going to run mediatomb with the -d option 
    enter the following (assuming bash):  
    export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5

Q:  How do I add an online stream?

A: To add an HTTP link to some external media do the following: 
    - In the UI, Browse Database, navigate to a container where you want to 
      put your stream. You can also create a new container for that if you 
      want to.  
  
    - Click on the "Add" icon (see the "Help" link, at the very bottom there 
      is a description to each icon).  
   
    - When the page for adding an item loaded, select "External Link (URL) 
      from the drop-down list. The page will change again, providing more 
      fields. 
    
    - Enter the Title of your stream (this title will show up on your renderer 
      box) 
     
    - Enter the full URL (http://someplace/somecoolstuff/somesong.mp3) 
      
    - Enter the UPnP class of an item (DSM-320 users take care! See forum post.)

    - Last, enter a mimetype... so you must find out yourself what kind of a 
      stream it is. For for example for an mp3 stream you would enter 
      "audio/mpeg".
