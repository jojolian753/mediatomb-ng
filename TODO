Known Issues (ordered by importance)
------------------------------------

- Although sqlite3 support is now optional, and won't be compiled in
  if not present, there are following problems to be fixed.
  - mediatomb server still looks for the sqlite3.db file.
  Hence sqlite3 is in fact NOT optional yet :)

- file extensions in extension-mimetype mappings are case sensitive.
  
- Make all metadata produced by javascript be stored in the database.
  Instead of iterating through all known metadata keys, should iterate
  through all meta properties of the object given to addCdsObject().
  (still don't know how to iterate over properties with spidermonkey)

- XML parser is very limited.
  Switching to expat would probably make sense. Correct XML parsing is 
  an essential capatility of a UPnP device.

- add mimetype mappings to serve request handler
  
Planned improvements / features (ordered by importance)
-------------------------------------------------------
- report right file length in file_request_handler
- readonly access to <res> metadata from
  javascript
- add auxilary metadata fields + readonly access from
  javascript

- introduce means to cascade scripts. Probably something like include()
  function or preprocessor directive.

- on the fly reloading of scripts and immediate automatic recreation
  of virtual structure. Should be simple - delete all virtual objects and
  pass every item inside the PC Directory to the script again. This will
  simplify development of JS scripts a lot.

- Ability to explicitely define filesystem directories and files
  visible to the filesystem browser. Will be done using the
  include/exclude ruleset semantics similar to Jakarta Ant.
