MediaTomb - UPnP AV Mediaserver for Linux.
v0.9.0  Major rework
        * integrated libupnp (http://pupnp.sf.net/) into our source tree
        * added largefile support
        * code has undergone some performance optimizations
        * fixed a bug where server did not shutdown while http download
          was in progress
        * all sqlite3 queries are now handled by a single, dedicated
          thread to make MediaTomb work with SQLite3 compiled with
          "--enable-threadsafe"
        * fixed a bug where setting -p 0 did not trigger automatic
          port selection if it had to override the value in config.xml
        * fixed bug 1425424 - crash on a bad config.xml - we did not handle 
          the case where the <udn> tag was not present.
          Thanks to Nektarios K. Papadopoulos <npapadop@users.sourceforge.net>
          for the report and patch.
        * added configure option and adapted the code to completely 
          supress all log output
        * added configure option and adapted the code to supress
          debug output
        * added taglib support,thanks to Benhur Stein <benhur.stein@gmail.com>
          for the patch. 
        * bug 1524468 (startup in daemon mode fails) does no longer occur
          after the integration of libupnp 1.4.x sources
        * fixed bug 1292295 (string conversion was failing on 64bit platforms)
        * fixed issue with ContainerUpdateIDs (were not sent out along with
          accepted subscription)
        * fixed issue where some directories could not be browsed (filesystem 
          browser). It turned out that we forgot to convert the filenames
          to UTF-8, as the result invalid characters made their way into
          the XML that was feeded to the browser.
        * improved illegal character conversion handling - in case iconv
          fails we will pad the rest of the name string with "?" and print
          out the failed name in the console.
        * we now try to determine the default import charsets by looking
          at the system locale.
        * implemented track number metadata extractino (feature request
          1430799). track numbers are now extracted via id3lib/taglib and
          can also be used in the import script. import.js has been adapted
          to add tracknumbers to song names in the Album container.
        * added option to supress hidden files when browsing the filesystem

v0.8.1
        * added "serve" directory, any files there can be downloaded 
          like from a normal webserver
        * implemented keyword extraction for auxdata from libexif
        * implemented keyword extraction for auxdata from libextractor
        * added Exif metadata support for images via libexif.
        * added resolution attribute to image res tag
        * added bitrate and duration attribute to mp3 res tag (via id3lib)
        * added auxdata field for items, auxilary data can be extracted
          and used by import scripts.
        * added configuration options to specify which aux fields should 
          be extracted and filled by the library.
	    * added mysql support
        * refined configure script, almost all dependencies are now
          optional.
	    * changed database, (not backward compatible again)
        * when an item is deleted all referenced items are deleted as well
        * added option to specify an alternative magic file

v0.8.0  15.06.2005  Scripting/Virtual Server Layout
        * Server layout can now be defined using java script,
          default layout script is provided.
        * Added ID3 tag support.
        * Fixed various memory leaks.
        * Files in the Filesystem Browser are now sorted alphabetically.
        * Added extension to mime-type mappings to the configuration.
        * Added option to limit import by file extensions.
        * Added daemon mode as well as setuid/setgid options, init.d
          script included.
        * Fixed mime-type recognition when importing media (filemagic output
          is now parsed using regular expressions)
        * Introduced new log system.
        * Adding/Browsing/Removing media in the UI is now handled
          asynchroniously.
        * Added a command line option to import media upon server launch.
        * Added target directory option to tomb-install, cleaned up a few
          things.

v0.7.1  17.04.2005  D-Link DSM-320 fix
        * Mappings of mime-types to upnp classes are now configurable.
          Actually this is how we solved the DSM-320 problem - they
          crashed if upnp class of items was different than what the
          DSM expected.

        * tomb-install now creates the database and configuration file
          from templates (was hardcoded); also sets the name of the server
          individually for each user (host / username)

        * Improved handling of configuration, if non critical options are
          missing we are now setting default values.

v0.7    14.04.2005  First release
        * The changelog does not start at day 0, updates will be made
          starting from this release.
