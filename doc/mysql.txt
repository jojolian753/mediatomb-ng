MySQL Database HOWTO for the impatient.

Please note, that this document does not handle the aspect of security,
its' solely purpose is to provide a quick walkthrough of setting up
mediatomb with MySQL.

The sole purpose of this document is to give users who have never dealt
with MySQL before the necessary minimum of information to install MySQL and
let mediatomb use it as backend for data storage.

For those even more impatient or not really interested at
what's going on try

# mysqladmin -u root create mediatomb
# cat <prefix>/share/mediatomb/mysql.sql | mysql -u root mediatomb

If no error messages come, you're done, just replace the storage section
in your config.xml with the following:
<storage driver="mysql">
  <host>localhost</host>
  <username>root</username>
  <password></password>
  <database>mediatomb</database>
</storage>


If the above does not work, you're doomed to at least read the following...

INSTALLING MYSQL
Normally MySQL database is shipped with several packages, those are
- Database server, everything necessary to run a database server.
  (the core package)
- Client program. This ships a program called "mysql", which is a small
  client program which you can use to instruct the server to create
  databases, run SQL queries, etc. You should have this one installed
  as well.
- Development libraries/header files
  These are necessary to compile mediatomb.

On Fedora the packages are called:
"mysql", "mysql-server" and "mysql-devel"

CREATING DATABASE
You must create a separate logical MySQL database and give mediatomb full
access to it.
In order to create a database you need to know it's username and password.
IMPORTANT NOTE! database usernames and passwords in MySQL have nothing
to do with unix accounts. MySQL has it's own usernames/passwords. However
mysql server may allow only certain unix users to manipulate databases.
On some distributions MySQL is installed with the main username
"root" and blank password. (I'll stress again to accent that this has
nothing to do with the system root user).

MySQL consists of several programs, and they share some command line
arguments. The programs you'll need to configure MySQL for mediatomb
both recognize following parameters:
  -u <username> : means to connect to database using the given username
     If -u is omited, the name of the currently logged in user is taken
     as a database username.
  -p (without argument!) : means to prompt for the password. If -p is
     omited the server assumes this user requires no password for
     authentication.

First you must do something like this:

# mysqladmin -u root create mediatomb

This tries to create a database called "mediatomb" using username "root"
and no password.

And afterwards:

# cat <prefix>/share/mediatomb/mysql.sql | mysql -u root mediatomb

Here you pass the mediatomb's database creation SQL script to the mysql
client connected to the previously created database.

Once this step is done, modify your mediatomb's config.xml file to use
the correct host, database name, user name and password.
